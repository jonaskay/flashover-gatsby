## Introduction

Strategy: What is it? Does it matter? How much time should companies spend on strategy? Are strategy consultants worth their hourly rates or are they false prophets?

I used to work at a software agency where I was once asked by my boss whether I would have something I could teach him about strategy given my academic background.

I'm a software developer. But I majored from strategic management and come from a school where a lot of the graduates get hired by the three world's largest strategy consulting firms (the Big Three or MBB) McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain & Company.

My answer to my boss's inquiry was a polite "no."

I was, and still am, a strategy skeptic. I was pretty sure that the business world constantly overestimated how much strategy mattered and how useful strategic analyses really were. But my thoughts around the subject were bit of a mess (perhaps they still are today).

When I said "no" to my boss, what I probably meant to say was "I don't know where to start."

## Strategy defined

So, what is strategy?

Before the 1960s, strategy was not a term one would casually drop in managerial discussions or business school lectures. It was a term of the military generals used to describe the means by which wars, not battles, would be won.

Perhaps if the managers of U.S. businesses in the 1960s would not have consisted predominantly of men—many of whom had served in the Second World War and were now spectating the ongoing Vietnam War—we would have adopted terms from another field of study to describe corporate planning.

But strategy became the word we use to describe a whole lot of high-level things related to companies operating in capitalist markets. Here are some ways in which the word is used:

- Strategy can be used to describe a plan driven by a specific business goal, or it can be used retrospectively to describe what a company actually ended up doing to get where it is today
- Strategy can be used to describe the ways in which companies try to outsmart each other
- Strategy can refer to visions and missions
- Strategy can refer to market positioning

There's also tactics—a term often accompanying strategy. Here's how the Prussian general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz defines the distinction between strategy and tactics:

> Tactics are the use of armed forces in a particular battle, while strategy is the doctrine of the use of individual battles for the purposes of war.
>
> —Carl von Clausewitz, On War (1832)

When moving from military strategy to business strategy, we might be able to draw an analogy between an opponent and a competitor. War could be seen as the never-ending effort to defend and grow market share. But what is the corporate equivalent of a battle? What are tactics?

We could say that tactics are concerned with the short-term and details whereas strategy focuses on the long-term. However, the line between short-term and long-term is not a clear one. Small events can also lead to dramatic changes and therefore a tactical goal can have a strategic impact. Trying to separate the two concepts can easily turn into more of an academic than a professional issue worth solving.

## Theories of success and failure

As wars and battles have victors and losers, so do industries have successes and failures. But why is this the case? If two companies offer the same product or service, why does the other company have more market share than the other?

If you have ever sat through an economics class, you have seen how prices are supposed to be determined at the point of equilibrium of the supply and demand model. Equilibrium is a central notion of neoclassical economics. It represents stability and optimization that markets try to uphold and will always move towards.

But when you look at the individual companies that operate in a market, change seems to be more prevalent than stability. Some companies go bankrupt and some companies outperform others by a factor of ten. Entrepreneurs and managers see this nonlinear movement of wealth and investments and want to know how they can make sure that they don't end up holding the short end of the stick.

But the advice neoclassical economists give leave the entrepreneurs wanting. One should set prices to an optimum and produce goods as long as the revenue gained from these goods is greater than the cost it takes to produce them. But how should one figure out what is the optimal price of a good and how does one even find customers for the produced goods?

In strategy, pricing is not an effort to move towards equilibrium but a position to be chosen: will you choose a low cost strategy or a differentiation strategy that enables premium pricing? And when it comes to differences in company performance, economists refer to the notion of marginal cost and marginal revenue but strategists talk about competitive advantages—the asymmetries between companies and markets that result in variation in performance.

These competitive advantages have two schools of thought that offer differing explanations for company success. The market-based view claims that the source of company success can be traced back to its environment. The resource-based view argues that the source of success is the company itself.

If you subscribe to the market-based view, strategy work becomes an effort of mapping the terrain and moving into positions that give its occupants an advantage. For example, you could use Michael Porter's five forces analysis to understand the state of your industry and then choose the most fitting strategy to defend yourself against the competitive forces around you.

A resource-based view on the other hand guides managers to count a company's tangible and intangible resources (buildings, employees, culture etc.) that are unique and valuable. If some important resources are missing, the company should try to acquire them.

Critics of the market-based view say that differences between company profitability are higher between companies inside an industry than between industries. In addition, the market-based view assumes that any company can move to any new strategic position depending on what is the most beneficial position at the moment.

Critics of the resource-based view say that the view doesn't take into account the environment that the company operates in. This doesn't seem like an unreasonable point of criticism either.

In practice, we can see companies adopting both views in their strategy. For example, the software company Intuit iterates on the way it organizes around its products and pursues new ideas (resource-based view) and at the same time pours millions of dollars to lobbying efforts to keep the demand high for its tax software in the U.S. by preventing legislative attempts to simplify tax filing (market-based view).
